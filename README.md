# STM32
The design of this board allowed me to familiarise myself with the KiCAD 7.0 interface. I used an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller with a 16 MHz AN2867 oscillator crystal, programmable via USB Micro type B.

As I went deeper into PCB design, I noticed some errors that affect the aesthetics, but not the performance, so I decided to correct them.
Among the list of improvements is:
- Eliminate tight angles on the tracks.
- Put the 3D model of the Micro USB port.
- Reducing the number of vias on the board.
- Redesigning the shape of the PCB board.
